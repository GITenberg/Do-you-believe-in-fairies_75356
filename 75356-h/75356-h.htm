<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LITTLE_GIRL">THE LITTLE GIRL</h2></div>


<p>The little girl ran and ran and let the wind
blow her hair until it stood out behind her as
though it were wired. The air was so clear
and blue that she thought: “If I jump a little
I will land on the top of that mountain over
there.”</p>

<p>But she didn’t jump. It would have been
taking a mean advantage of the mountain,
she thought. She would just fly up the side
of it, much as she was flying along the road
now. And when she had gotten to the
very topmost part, she would not deign
to look down upon all the silly people in the
valley—the people who just went on working,
and didn’t have the sense to shout with joy
because the sun was shining. She would
reach up her hand, and feel the little fleecy
cloud that was sitting so still and quiet, way
up there. She would squash it between her
fingers to see if it was wet or dry. And if it
was dry, she would wrap it around her, to
keep it warm forever, and would spend the rest
of her days trying to catch, in a rose-colored
bottle, the cold wind that went rushing past.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<p>And so the little girl ran and ran.</p>

<p>The wind whistled at her speed. The dewy
grass kissed her feet, and the cows in the
meadows yawned as she passed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Then she stumbled. A round smooth rock
had rolled across her path: a granite rock, with
specks that twinkled like bad men’s eyes. It
was an orthodox rock—the sort that rarely
rolled from its ledge. It growled:</p>

<p>“Look at this astounding young person’s
behavior on a Sunday! The idea! A gentleman
and a preacher should put an end to such
goings-on.”</p>

<p>And so the smooth stone rolled in her path-way,
and she stumbled and fell over it.</p>

<p>A discreet silence had settled over the countryside,
just as though all the fields were on
their best behavior. The rows and rows of
conscientiously trained beets and onions drew
themselves up in the pride of their posture.
They too are very orthodox. They look down
upon those of their vegetable brethren who
have allowed themselves to be blown away
from the straight and narrow path while still
in the seed stage. It is fair, in a kingdom of
stones, that these should do penance by eternal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>excommunication from the pale. And thus
pondering, in pious disgust, the beets and carrots
were spending their Sunday.</p>

<p>The truant asparagus, long since reformed
from rigid rows, was glorifying heaven in its
own sweet way. It sprawled over the edge of
its patch, as though to cover as much of the
earth as possible—to be as near to her as possible.
It does her honor, by dressing up in
feathery finery to adorn her. It even catches
the dew-drops, and roguishly uses them as
pearls; for it makes its religion a perpetual
pageant to glorify nature, and it scorns the
priggish severity of the onion elders who have
carefully stored up all their dew, for the cultivation
of orthopedic roots.</p>

<p>These were the extremes of the vegetable
Sunday behavior, and they are interspersed
with just such in between stages as the meadows
show,—a sort of tired business man-ish
relief from the droning haying machines, and
the hard cobble-stone wall.</p>

<p>Over the vegetable kingdom the round
stones rule in their smooth sly fashion, appearing
in the furrows to retard the busy harrower
in his task, and censoring the human
children’s play.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<p>But past them all the Little Girl ran, laughing
at the wind, brushing off the dirt that
spotted her starched dress, and forgetting all
about her bruises and scratches. On and on
she ran, her eye fixed on the fleecy white cloud,
her heart aching to fondle it, and her legs
tireless in their never-ending race for the stars.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TO_PLEASE_EIGHT_AND_A_HALF">TO PLEASE EIGHT AND A HALF</h2></div>


<p>First of all there was Mildred, who was
eleven, and quite sedate. Then there were the
twins, Eveline and Madeline, who were eight
and a half and eight and a half and ten minutes
old, respectively, and who liked stories.</p>

<p>“Can you tell ’em?” Madeline inquired
anxiously. She was curled up in my lap, and
when she spoke she wrinkled up her nose in
a funny little way that hid the one freckle on
its tip that was the only means of distinguishing
her from Eveline.</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” I offered.</p>

<p>“Make it about goblins, please,” ordered
Madeline.</p>

<p>“And fairies,” Eveline added.</p>

<p>“And real people, too,” suggested Mildred
who was, as I said, eleven, and almost beyond
fairies, which was rather a pity.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time,” I started, and paused.
A grown-up had interrupted us with some
foolish grown-up question.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time,” again I began.</p>

<p>“You said that before,” objected Eveline.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” accused Madeline.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>
<p>“—Many, many years ago, there was a big
forest, bigger than any you have ever seen.”</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, Ma’am, I know where there is a
biggest forest.”</p>

<p>“Well, this was even bigger,” I insisted. “So
big, in fact, that the leaves were as large as—as
the flowers on that chair.” I finished pointing
to the exaggerated tapestry on the furniture.</p>

<p>“Now at the edge of the woods there was a
little village, where a blacksmith lived, with
his only daughter, Hope.</p>

<p>“One day he sent Hope out into the forest to
pick berries. As she went into the woods, by
the little path which led from her house, there
hopped out on it a little bunny—like the ones
in the park, you know, excepting that this one
had <b>two</b> tails.”</p>

<p>(“Why?” asked Madeline.</p>

<p>“To clean out his house with, of course,”
explained Mildred.)</p>

<p>“Now, although Hope had walked in the
forest ever since she was a little girl, she had
never, <b>never</b> seen a bunny with two tails. So
she followed this one. Further and further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>she went, and darker and darker it grew, but
Hope did not notice this, for she was too busy
watching Mr. Two-tails.</p>

<p>“Suddenly he disappeared, and left her standing
in front of a great, green-grey stone. It
was very dark, and poor Hope was very much
frightened. I would have been, too. Wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>Three heads bobbed up and down energetically,
and three pairs of eyes opened <b>very</b>
wide.</p>

<p>“But she was a sensible little girl, and knew
that the good fairies would help her. So she
knocked on the stone. There started a whirring
noise, as of wings.</p>

<p>“Say the magic word, and tell me your
name,” sang a silvery voice.</p>

<p>“Hope,” said the little girl.</p>

<p>At this the stone opened, and she went into
a beautiful little room, all lighted with fireflies
and glow-worms. On the floor sat a fairy, busy
mending a butterfly’s broken wing.</p>

<p>‘Do you live here all alone?’ asked Hope,
as she drank honey and dew-drops which the
busy ants had brought her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>
<p>“Yes,” sighed the fairy sadly. “I used to
live with the forest goblins—”</p>

<p>“But they are bad,” interrupted Hope.
“Father has told me stories about them.”</p>

<p>“Not bad!” reproved the fairy “but they did
not like me to help the wood-land folks. They
made me come here, and said they would keep
every one from seeing me. Nobody can enter
without the pass-word, Hope. And I cannot
be free until a prince comes to sing to me.”</p>

<p>“The next morning the blacksmith awoke,
and called Hope to him, but of course she did
not come. He was very much frightened and
called out all the village folk to help look for
her. Then a strange thing happened. The
blacksmith looked at the wall of his hut, and
saw a message appear in letters of gold which
said, ‘Whosoever shall find Hope shall be made
by the fairies a Prince, and shall be given a
beauteous castle.’</p>

<p>“The villagers started out, and with them a
little apprentice lad searched too. Now, of
course, the goblins kept every one away from
the great green-grey stone, but in spite of all
the goblin’s enchantments the apprentice lad
came to the house of the fairy, because he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>followed a little two-tailed bunny. And when
he got there he was so happy he just sang, and
sang, and as he sang his coarse village clothes
fell off him and the royal robes of a Prince appeared
in their place.</p>

<p>“And so he took Hope back to the village
with him, and the fairy flew out, singing and
happy to be free. At the village there was
great rejoicing, and they feasted at the Prince’s
palace for a month and a day.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they get sick?” inquired Mildred.</p>

<p>“And a few years later they were married.”</p>

<p>“And lived happily ever after?” asked Eveline,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“And lived happily ever after!” I assured
them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TALE_OF">THE TALE OF
THE FRETFUL CHILD</h2></div>


<p>There lived once upon a time, in the Land
of Grown-ups, a very little boy. As soon as he
was old enough to cry, which was when he was
very young indeed, he began to cry for an
adventure. But he always cried for it in baby talk,
which Grown-ups cannot understand because
they have forgotten it; and so nobody
knew what he wanted. They gave him milk,
and they spanked him. They sang to him and
they rocked him, and they even showed him
how the wheels in Daddy’s watch go round.
But they did not give him an adventure, and
so he kept right on crying, until bye and bye
he came to be known as That Fretful Child,
and everyone hated his parents.</p>

<p>Now there is only one person in all Grown-up
Land who understands baby talk, and that
is the Oldest Woman in the World. People
say that she understands it only because she is
so old that she has learned everything there is
to know and is going back to begin all over
again. And, since she is as wise as she is old,
and equally as gossipy, she soon heard everyone
talking about That Fretful Child.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>
<p>She suspected that the baby wanted something
very badly, and that that something was
neither warm milk, nor a spanking, nor the
wheels in Daddy’s watch. And she decided to
find out what it was that he did want.</p>

<p>So she put on her grey cobweb scarf, which
makes her invisible, and climbed up the handle
of her carpet-sweeper, for she is a very modern
Old Woman indeed. She grasped the handle
of her carpet-sweeper, right where the shiny
part ends, said a magic word, which I have
forgotten, and Higgelley, piggelley, before you
might say “<b>I spy</b>” three times without winking,
she was driving up to the home of the
Fretful Child with a fearful clatter.</p>

<p>Now the Fretful Child’s Mother was a regular
sort of a Mother, excepting that on Sunday’s
she always used silk handkerchiefs, embroidered
with storks, and folded in thirds, instead
of the linen ones folded in quarters that
she used every day. When she heard the
noise, and saw the carpet-sweeper drive up to
the door she became very much excited.</p>

<p>“Look, Timothy,” she called to her husband,
who is also the Baby’s Father, “Look at the
carpet-sweeper I have found outside of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>door.” In Grown-up Land, you see, carpet
sweepers do not always wander about by themselves.</p>

<p>Timothy, however was not impressed. He
only said “Un-huh”, and went on reading his
newspaper.</p>

<p>So the Fretful Child’s Mother took in the
carpet-sweeper, and put it next to the Baby’s
crib, for safe-keeping. Then, because the baby
was crying very hard indeed, she hurried away
to get him some warm milk, and left him alone
to drink it, for she had learned by experience
that he could not cry while he was doing this.</p>

<p>When she had gone, the Oldest Woman
hopped down from the carpet-sweeper, and
took off her cobweb scarf, which made her visible.
Then she looked at the Fretful Child
over her dark green spectacles, and said:</p>

<p>“Google de Goo.”</p>

<p>Now the Baby was so surprised to hear anyone
besides himself speaking his language, that
he stopped swallowing warm milk, right in
the middle of a gulp, and simply stared. But,
although this is generally considered very rude,
the Oldest Woman paid no attention to it whatsoever,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>and instead went right on to say something
which translated means:</p>

<p>“What are you crying for, anyway?”</p>

<p>By that time the Fretful Child had stopped
staring, and had finished his warm milk, and
was able to tell her that he wanted an adventure,
and that he wanted it badly.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this, the Oldest Woman became
very serious indeed. She shook her head,
and wiped away a tear which had settled on
the rim of her green spectacles and was about
to roll down her nose. Then she said:</p>

<p>“Doodle de doo,” which, as all babies know,
means “You are very young indeed, but I will
do the best I can for you.”</p>

<p>She told him that there are very few places
where adventures still grow wild, for they have
all been collected many years ago by a group
of people called “Famous Persons”. However,
she did know of one adventure tree that was
just beginning to bear fruit. It was quite far
away, but all that one needed to get there was
a silk handkerchief embroidered with a stork.
Now this was very fortunate indeed. For you
see, the baby knew that once a week his Mother
used to wipe his tears off with a silk handkerchief,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>and he remembered that something on it
sometimes used to bite him.</p>

<p>“It must have been a stork,” exclaimed the
Oldest Woman, and at this she became so excited
that her eyes twinkled behind her green
spectacles.</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell about it, the
baby was flying through the air on his Mother’s
silk handkerchief, with his eyes tightly closed,
and the Oldest Woman was astride a carpet-sweeper.
He could feel the wind blowing
through his hair, and the stars snapping at him
as he went whizzing past. All the time the
Oldest Woman kept saying magic words, and
telling him not to open his eyes whatever he
did, so that it all sounded something like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">Hoity toity, keep them shut,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Ali pali poo,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Flutter, gutter, down he’ll clut</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Sniggle, snaggle yo-u-u-u-u</div>
<div class="verse indent0">O-o-o-o-w</div>
<div class="verse indent0">You-u-u-u-u</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>And all the voices of the night owls and snapping
stars echoed</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">You-u-u-u-u-u-u-U*U*U*U!</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Until the Fretful Child felt very pale indeed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<p>When at last the Oldest Woman told him
that he might look, he found that they had
flown all the way to Nowhereland. He knew
it was Nowhereland, by all the Nothings standing
about. There were tall Nothings, and
short Nothings, and fat Nothings, and thin
Nothings, and they were all kept in order by
Nobodies with grey dresses on. These Nobodies
are very much like the people in Grown-up
Land. Excepting that, as you will notice
when you look at them very closely, their faces
are made up entirely of cheeks.</p>

<p>The Fretful Child stared about very hard
indeed. Then, because he couldn’t see any adventure
tree, he was just beginning to take a
long breath in order to cry. But he stopped
short, just as his face was beginning to turn
from pink to purple. For, right in the midst
of the Nobodies stood the most beautiful adventure
tree you ever saw. Its pale blue
branches were weighed down to the place
where the ground would have been, if there
had been a ground in Nowhereland. And from
even the lowest branches there hung luscious
adventures that were dark red, and just right
for picking. All about lay others that the wind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>had blown down, or that the Nobodies had
picked, tasted, and thrown away. But they
had missed the very best of all. And this was
perfectly natural, when you stop to think that
the Nobodies have no eyes, and their faces are
made up entirely of cheeks.</p>

<p>But the Fretful Child was not a Nobody. He
had eyes. He saw the red adventures dangling
there, and he squealed and crowed, and did all
the things that fretful children never do. And
then he picked one.</p>

<p>Now it is strange to tell about, but as soon as
the Fretful Child bit into that adventure, he
stopped being a Fretful Child, and became a
Regular Boy. Even his skin, at that very moment
forgot how to change from pink to
purple, as it used to when he wanted to cry.</p>

<p>When the Nobodies felt what he was doing,
they became very angry indeed, and shouted
Nonsense at him, and threw Nothings at him.
But these did not hurt him much, and so he
went right on eating his adventure.</p>

<p>The adventure did not taste at all the way he
thought it would, and it puckered his mouth
all up. So he tried to hold his breath to make
his face change from pink to purple, but it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>wouldn’t do what he told it to. And then he
knew that the adventure must have done something
to him. He was not sure, but he strongly
suspected that it must have changed him into
a Regular Boy. So he stopped crying, even
before he had let out the tiniest bit of a sound,
and he smiled all over instead. And thereupon
the Nobodies, feeling that some thing just
hadn’t happened, dropped their nothings on
the spot. And a brand new adventure bloomed
on the tree, where the one the Fretful Child
had eaten hung.</p>

<p>He squealed in glee, and looked around for
the Oldest Woman, but as she was as wise as
she was old, and equally as gossipy, she must
have ridden away on her carpet-sweeper to tell
her friends about it, for she was not to be
found.</p>

<p>Just as he was wondering where she could
have gone to, he felt a tugging at his right
arm. It was the embroidered stork. Without
a minute’s delay he climbed upon the handkerchief,
stuck out his tongue at the Nobodies,
which shows that he was a Regular Boy, and,
higgelley, piggelley, before you might say “I
spy” three times without winking, he was back
in his own little crib.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<p>His Mother was just coming to get the carpet-sweeper,
which she had left beside the crib,
for, you see, in Grown-up Land time passes
much more slowly than in Nowhere land.
There was a great to-do when she found that it
was gone, but just as she was growing very
excited about this, she noticed that the Fretful
Child had stopped crying, and this made her
even more excited (but in a different way) so
that she forgot all about the carpet-sweeper.
She rushed in to tell Timothy, her husband
about it; but he was reading the newspaper,
and only said “Un-huh.”</p>

<p>Soon all the neighbors came in to find out
why That Fretful Child had stopped crying,
and his Mother proudly told them that she had
given him warm milk.</p>

<p>Whereupon all the neighbors shook their
heads and opened their mouths very wide, and
went home to feed warm milk to their Fretful
Children, as they have been doing ever since.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_JUSTIFICATION_AND">THE JUSTIFICATION AND
REVENGE OF GOBBLE-ME-UP
<br>
(A Story for Children with Appetites,
and for Children Who Do Not Eat.)</h2></div>


<p>Once upon a time, in the days of long ago,
when ogres and giants were as plentiful as
policemen, and when the ocean was dotted
with desert islands, there lived a Giant whose
name was Gobble-me-up. As you may have
guessed, he lived on one of these islands. All
about him stretched ocean, and ocean, and
more and more waves; but they didn’t bother
him at all. He just lived there alone, and was
very happy.</p>

<p>He was a great, large, burly giant, who
would have stood over six feet tall in his stocking
feet, if he had worn stockings. He had
round red cheeks, and dancing blue eyes, and
his hair curled itself up into “irrepressible
locks” just like your favorite hero’s. He was
comfortably fat, and when he laughed he
shook all over, just the way the dessert that
we have on Sunday does.</p>

<p>As I said, he was a very happy giant indeed,
and he used to laugh and shake all over a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>very great deal. You see, he never realized
that he was all alone on his island, because he
had never known what it would be like to
have someone there to play with him. Every
morning when he had finished his rhubarb, he
used to walk along the seashore, dabbling his
toes in the soapy waves, and singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Gobble-me-up is my name,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">A Happy Giant am I ...</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And I always feel just the same ...</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And I’ll sing this song till I die.”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>When he came to this point he would always
whirl about on his left heel three times, and
clap his hands above his head.</p>

<p>Now at the particular moment when my
story would be beginning if I hadn’t wasted
all this time talking, Gobble-me-up was just
setting out for his morning walk. He was
tossing his head in the breeze ... it was the
first day of Spring, you see ... and he
breathed in the ozone, and enjoyed it, because
he didn’t know that it was ozone. And, according
to his habit, he began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Gobble-me-up is my name....”</div></div>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>
<p>when all of a sudden three clams that were
lying on the beach opened their shells very
wide, and laughed, in perfect rhythm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Ha! HA!! HA!!!”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Gobble-me-up looked about in surprise, and
the clams continued to laugh in a way that was
rude, even for clams.</p>

<p>Then Gobble-me-up became very angry ...
no self-respecting Giant likes to be laughed at.
He shook his curls at them, trying to look very
fierce indeed. At last he sputtered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“WHAT do you</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Mean</div>
<div class="verse indent0">By</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Talking to</div>
<div class="verse indent0">ME</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Like <b>that</b>?”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>(He was so angry, you see, that he leaped
into free verse, a thing which had always been
against his principles.)</p>

<p>When the clams had laughed until they
could laugh no more, and had rolled over in
the sand to wipe the perspiration off their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>shells, the most imposing clam answered him.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” she said (I am quite sure it was
a “she”), “the idea of a giant who only eats
rhubarb ... he! he! ... the idea of <b>his</b> being
called Gobble-me-up!”</p>

<p>At this all the other clams went off into
wild gales of laughter, and snapped their shells
to show how very funny they thought it was.</p>

<p>Gobble-me-up was perplexed. He didn’t
quite know what they meant. But they did
not intend to leave him in any doubt about this.
They explained immediately, interrupting
each other, and acting in a way that was very
rude indeed.</p>

<p>They said that he ought to be a “very-cannibal-and-wear-a-red-sash-and-whiskers-and-eat-up-little-boys-and-girls”
(they said it
quickly, like that) and that he ought to go
around muttering dreadful things like:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Fe, fi, fo, fum,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">I smell the blood of an Englishmun,”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>instead of reciting his silly little rhymes.
They said that he should flourish a tomahawk,
and dye his hair black, or at least train it to
stand up on end. In fact they abused him horribly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>telling him that he was ruining the time-honored
reputation of the race of Giants. Any
Giant, they said, to be worthy of the name,
should endeavor to represent all the Giants on
every occasion. He, they said, was an unsatisfactory
specimen, and therefore deserved to be
squelched most effectively. This they felt to
be their duty, and unpleasant though it was, it
had to be done.</p>

<p>After this last remark, they sighed sadly,
and retired into their shells.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>From that moment on, Gobble-me-up was a
changed giant. He hardly ever laughed, and
when he sang his little song he put it in a
minor key, which shows how very sad he was.
Every morning he spoiled his rhubarb by
weeping salty tears into it.</p>

<p>He felt that he really must do <b>something</b>.</p>

<p>He sat down on a log to think about it. He
turned his toes inward so that they might console
each other. He dug his elbows hard into
his knees, and held his forehead in his hands.
Then he said to himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“The clams win out,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Without a doubt,</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p><div class="verse indent0">I’ve simply ruined my rep ...</div>
<div class="verse indent0">I must fix this,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Or else, I wis,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">I’ll have to get some pep.”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>This last thought seemed to appeal to him a
great deal, even though the rhyme wasn’t very
good.</p>

<p>But as he pondered it, he had a more awful
thought. How could he act like a blood-thirsty
Giant, and go about killing men, when he was
the only creature that was anything like a man
on the island?</p>

<p>It was a most disturbing idea, and for three
days it bothered him. He grew paler, and proportionately
thinner. He did not weep into
his rhubarb now, but left it strictly alone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And then he found a solution, and worked
it out in a manner truly worthy of a Giant.
This was what he did:</p>

<p>One night, when the moon was hidden and
the stars were yawning and dropping off to
sleep, one by one, he crept out along the beach.
Without a sound, he crept up behind the three
sleeping clams. Stealthily he reached out his
left hand, took the youngest by its little neck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>and squashed it. Noiselessly he stretched out
his right hand, and grasped the second one.
And with a maddened shriek of triumph he
grabbed up the last clam, before it could snap
its shell at him.</p>

<p>With an exalted countenance, he pranced
up and down the beach, shouting his paean of
victory, so that the stars stopped blinking, and
the moon peered around the corner of a cloud
to listen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Gobble-me-up is my name,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">A Fearsome Giant am I,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">I’ve a dreadful awesome fame,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Which nobody can deny...!</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Gobble-me-up is my name,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">No Giant is madder than I ...</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Ha! <b>Ha!!</b> Ha! <b>Ha!!</b></div>
<div class="verse indent0">No Giant is madder than I!”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Whereupon he sat down on his log, and, one
by one he <b>ate</b> the clams.</p>

<p>It didn’t matter at all that he had indigestion
the next day. He knew that he really was
an honest-to-goodness Giant, and the thought
made him laugh and shake all over, just as he
used to do in the good old days, before the
clams had tried to disillusion him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_INTERVIEW_WITH">AN INTERVIEW WITH
RICHARD THE LION-HEARTED</h2></div>


<p>“I don’t like women,” said Richard of Brookline,
and to prove it he sucked more violently
upon a lavender lollipop.</p>

<p>Richard spoke with all the authority of one
who has spent seven years living across the
street from five fair ladies. One might mention
that these seven years were his first spent
anywhere, and that these fair but fearsome
feminists ranged from six to sixteen. The
locale was Brookline, and the time romantic
summer—at this point my story begins.</p>

<p>Not long ago Richard wandered down the
broad highway sucking upon his solitary lollipop,
and wearing on his eyebrows the air of a
world-weary capitalist. He did not offer to
share his bounty with the ladies across the
way, but did not object to having them watch
him from their lollipopless porch. It was this
haughty attitude that first made the Sleuth
suspect him to be a woman hater.</p>

<p>And so the Sleuth set off upon his trail immediately,
but Richard, like many a courtly
gentleman, proved to be as diffident as he was
bold.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>
<p>“Why don’t you like women?” he was asked.
And he replied:</p>

<p>“Because.”</p>

<p>“Because what?” the Sleuth persisted;
whereupon Richard raised his eyebrows with
an air of finality.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t,” he said.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like your Mama?” he was asked,
and regarded the questioner scornfully.</p>

<p>“She isn’t a girl,” quoth he.</p>

<p>“But she probably was once!” The Sleuth
hazarded a guess.</p>

<p>Alas, at this point Richard was called to bed.
But the next day the argument was continued.
It was after a nerve-racking game of puss-in-the-corner,
when the assembled court had been
astonished at the lion-hearted Richard’s chivalry.
Twice had he surrendered his hard-earned
corner to a fluffy little four-year-old
blond. The Sleuth joshed him as man to man.
But Richard smiled about it, and man-like
waived present contingencies to speak glittering
generalities.</p>

<p>“Girls,” he said, “are like fish.” But he omitted
further details; and as he mused on the
matter, his thoughts fell into metaphors.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>“Like fish,” he repeated solemnly. And then
he spied a crop of bobbed and almost masculine
hair that was bouncing outside the hedge
fence. “Or like hares. Some say that they are
chickens, but I think that they are more like
trees.”</p>

<p>“Because they wear fine feathers,” someone
contributed.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he agreed.</p>

<p>“But you don’t think they’re all shady, do
you?” the Sleuth hastened to interpose.</p>

<p>“Most are,” he sighed.</p>

<p>And at this point he rose, to show that the
interview was at an end, and, swinging his tin
drum about his neck, he solemnly paraded
down the block to that very masculine tune
“Johnny get your Gun.”</p>

<p>Once upon a time before Caesar had conquered
Britain, and therefore in the very early
days indeed, there dwelt in southern England
a princess named Talc. Her life was pampered
and happy, just like the lives of all the
princesses who lived a long time ago. Each
day she sat by the edge of a pool of still green
water, and allowed her handmaidens to comb
her tresses (it was in the days, you see, when
ladies wore tresses where most modern folk
wear hair).</p>

<p>“I am very beautiful,” she remarked casually,
glancing at herself in the pool, “but ...”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Madam,” chorused the handmaidens,
who did not realize that she was
about to say more.</p>

<p>“Silence, wretches,” snapped the princess,
squirting water at them with a lily white hand,
and thereby mussing up her image in the pool.
Then she continued in a low tragic tone: “I
have a blemish, I tell you. My nose shines.
Poets have written of brilliant eyes and gleaming
teeth, but not one has mentioned a glittering
nose. Therefore I know that the perfect
nose does not shine. My beauty is ruined. Ah
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>woe is me, ah woe is me!” An she bowed her
head forward, sobbing so violently that she
pulled the pigtails out of her handmaidens’
grasp.</p>

<p>“No more,” she roared at them, as they
started to reclaim the lost tresses. And then
she sobbed as though her heart would break,
“Oh my blemish, oh my nose, oh my nose, oh
my blemish. Throw away your combs. I am
going to tell the sea of my woe. I am going to
walk along the cliffs. You may follow at a
distance.”</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, and hurried to the
cliffs. She looked at the sea roaring on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>“Oh sea,” she moaned in her grief, “what
would you do if you had a nose and it was
shiny?”</p>

<p>As she was thus bewailing she stumbled and
fell upon the smooth, soft, chalky cliffs. When
she lifted herself up she found that her hands
were covered with a white dust.</p>

<p>“Arabella!” she called to her handmaiden,
“bring me a bowl of water.”</p>

<p>Talc looked into the glassy surface of the
water. Lo and behold her nose no longer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>shone, but was white with a thick opaque
whiteness!</p>

<p>“My beauty!” she exulted, “my beauty has
returned! Arabella, you may get the comb
and continue in the making of my royal pigtails.
Neither my nose nor my chin shines.
I am truly beautiful.” And she rejoiced until
the tears flowed down her face, making furrows
in their whiteness.</p>

<p>And thereafter each morning the princess
and her handmaidens could be seen prostrate
upon the cliff, solemnly rubbing their noses in
its smooth dust.</p>

<p>“We had a table cloth, as white as the paint
on the wall beside my kitchen stove, when
it was new, five years ago. Ice tinkled in the
glasses, but I saw every glass cloud up to hide
the ice, because it costs an awful lot these days:
They brought the turkey in,—it must have
weighed twelve pounds. Its brown breast was
so fat it seemed about to burst. It sizzled.
Um. Then came the cranberry, all red and
clear and quivery from its mold. A pianola
played all the time, and we danced on the swell
white tiles up to the cashier’s desk.</p>

<p>“I had on a picture hat, black velvet, trimmed
with fur and cloth of gold, just like a movie star—that’s
how I felt. Say, ain’t it queer, the
things you dream about?”</p>

<p>A half a loaf of bread lay awry on a crumby
and rumpled and mended table cloth where
the breakfast dishes were stacked in crooked
piles. The room was dark ... an oil stove in
the corner made the hot air heavier. On the
tubs, wrapped in towels, a tiny baby lay. The
mother was speaking: and trying to wipe the
wisps of hair out of her heavy eyes. She said:
“Say, ain’t it queer the things you dream
about?”</p>

<p>Christmas doesn’t come on the twenty-fifth
of December. It begins with the first cold,
snappy day, when ladies, fur-coated, and with
unaccustomed red noses patter down Broadway.
Tall fragrant pine trees, their branches
roped in, are piled on the curbs. There are
little stacks of very, very green stands, leaning
against a box of rosy cheeked apples. Delivery
boys bustle about, much more energetically
than ever before. In the windows cauliflowers
and half frozen beets cuddle in a bed
of red crepe paper in an attempt to keep warm
and cheerful. Next door the fish-man has
garnished his wares with holly and eked a
“Merry Christmas” on the frosty window
pane. On the corner the Salvation Army girl
stamps to keep warm and tinkles her little
bell.</p>

<p>And it’s not even December twenty-fourth!</p>

<p>Footsteps paced down the hall—slow, meditative
footsteps, with long intervals between
them. Then there was a swish of skirts, and
little pattering taps on the hard marble. Then
both footsteps stopped, and I heard a high
treble tittering, and a deep long-drawn out,
but kindly roar. There was a clatter as though
books had fallen on the floor—another titter,
and rather a bored basso sigh. A bell rang.
The pattering and swishing recommenced and
faded out of earshot. The steady, determined
strides drew nearer and nearer—and by that
time the second bell had rung—and the door

<p>I staggered up the last step of the golden

Peter came over to me and flapped his wings
in my face. I noticed that the wings were all
lettered—A.B.C.D.—I didn’t look further.</p>

gloatingly fingered his keys. The largest was
square and shiny—a Phi Beta Kappa Key.</p>

from my pocket. St. Peter took it, slowly
looked at it upside down, then sideways, then
right side up.</p>

vagueness, “Un-huh,” he repeated wisely.</p>

<p>St. Peter turned around slowly, showing me
a great expanse of wing.</p>

<p>“Close your eyes,” he said, “and pull out a
feather, and while you are about it, take one
for each of your little friends.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see which one to choose, if I close
my eyes,” I objected most knowingly.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make any difference which one
you choose,” said St. Peter, “I only give them
out as souvenirs. A feather doesn’t really
help you to fly. It just gives you confidence.
The rest is up to you.”</p>
